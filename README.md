# Fitness Dashboard DDD

This repository is just for my studies.\
I wanted to create this for improve my knowleages about DDD.\
Especially about the file and directories structure.

I don't create this repo based *totally* in TDD.\
I just created some tests, but don't test it really.\
I was thinking about the structure.

- the user can `create an account`
- the user can `add your weight and height`
- the user can `calculate your bmr`
- the user can `track your measurements`
